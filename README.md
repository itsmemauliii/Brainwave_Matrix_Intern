# Brainwave Matrix Solutions Internship Project: Superstore Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the Superstore Sales Analysis project! This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboard insights developed during my internship at **Brainwave Matrix**.

This project focuses on understanding key business metrics from a fictional superstore dataset using **Python**, **Power BI**, and **data visualization techniques**.

## Notebook Analysis Summary

From the `superstore_analysis (3).ipynb`, here are the key findings:

### Data Overview

- No missing values in the dataset  
- 9,994 rows and 21 columns  
- Key columns: `Sales`, `Profit`, `Category`, `Region`, `State`, `Discount`

### Key Insights

- **Technology** category leads in overall sales  
- **Chairs, Tables, Bookcases** often lead to losses  
- **Central Region** shows negative profit, needs strategic attention  
- **High discounts (>30%)** tend to result in negative profits  
- **California** and **New York** are the most profitable states  
- Most customers prefer **Standard Class** shipping

### Key Visual Elements

- **KPI Cards**: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Discount  
- **Profit by Region**: West is the top performer; Central underperforms  
- **Sales vs Profit Trend**: Negative correlation with increasing discounts  
- **Top Products by Sales**: Phones, Accessories, Binders  
- **Loss-Making Categories**: Chairs and Tables in particular
